## Description
This program recreates the game mechanics of the arcade game Galaxian. Galaxian is a fixed shooter arcade game that was created in 1979 by Namco. I completed this project as part of my coursework for Design of Large Programs, CS 351, taught by Joseph Haugh at the University of New Mexico. Professor Haugh provided project guidelines, and example of how to implement Pong using Java FX, and guidance and advice.

## Inspiration
I used a video of the arcade game's gameplay as inspiration. I also drew inspiration from Lee Stemkowski's YouTube tutorial on how to code Asteroids using Java FX, as well as from Gaspar Coding's video on how to recreate Space Invaders. I used GPT-4 and Open AI's Playground as tools throughout the process. 

## How to play the game
Download and run the executable .jar file.
