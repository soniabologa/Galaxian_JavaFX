## Description
This program recreates the game mechanics of the arcade game Galaxian.
Galalxian is a fixed shooter arcade game that was created in 1979 by Namco.

## Inspiration
I used a video of the arcade game's gameplay as inspiration. I also drew inspiration
from Lee Stemkowski's YouTube tutorial on how to code Asteroids using Java FX, 
as well as from Gaspar Coding's video on how to recreate Space Invaders. I used
GPT-4 and Open AI's Playground as tools throughout the process. 

## Challenges
One challenge with this assignment was building it incrementally
in a way that would allow me to test small parts as I wrote them. The most 
difficult part for me to implement was having new enemies spawn at the top of the
screen, travel down, and join the enemy formation. I recognize that was difficult 
because choices I have made early on (about the data structure that holds the enemies,
 and how enemies are drawn on the screen). I spent about a week on that aspect of the game
alone. 

## Next steps
The next steps for this game would be adding graphics: Scrolling stars in the background,
images for the spaceship and the alien enemies, and, every time there is a collision,
a sequence of images that represent an explosion. I'd also edit the pathway of the diving 
and entering enemies to match the curvilinear pathways the enemies take in the game. 
I'd also add a main menu, and an end game screen. Another fun addition could be 
implementing various levels of difficulty.
